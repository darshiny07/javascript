    <h1>Closure in javascript</h1>
<p>Lexical Scope: In JavaScript, functions are defined within other functions or blocks. When a function is defined inside another function, the inner function has access to variables and parameters of the outer function. This concept is called lexical scope.</p>

<br>
<p>usage :Encapsulation and Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods. By enclosing variables within a function's scope, you can prevent external code from accessing or modifying them directly, thus ensuring data privacy and encapsulation.</p>

        function outerFun() {
            let outerVariable = "outer briyani"
            function innerFun() {
                let innerVariable = "inner curd"
                console.log(outerVariable);
                console.log(innerVariable);
            }
